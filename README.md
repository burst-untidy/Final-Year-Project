Haemorrhage Detection using Deep Learning

📄 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based system for the detection of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) from brain CT scans. The system aims to assist medical professionals in diagnosing haemorrhagic conditions rapidly and accurately through automated image analysis.

🎯 Objectives

- To collect and preprocess brain CT images for haemorrhage classification.
- To design and train convolutional neural network (CNN) models capable of identifying haemorrhagic cases.
- To evaluate the performance of the models using clinical metrics.
- To create a prototype of a diagnostic interface for practical usability.

🧠 Methodology

- Data Collection: Brain CT scan datasets from public repositories or hospital archives.
- Preprocessing: Grayscale normalization, resizing, and contrast enhancement. Augmentation is applied to improve generalization.
- Model Development: Models like U-Net, ResNet-50, and DenseNet121 will be explored.
- Training & Evaluation: Dataset is split for training, validation, and testing. Evaluation using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC.
- UI Integration: Simple interface enabling image upload and automated report generation.

🗂️ Dataset

- Source: Publicly available brain CT datasets (e.g., CQ500, RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection).
- Classes: Haemorrhage vs Normal.
- Format: Grayscale JPEG images.
- Preprocessing Tools: OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras preprocessing utilities.

Usability: Generate structured diagnostic reports with image annotations.

🔮 Future Work

Expand to multiclass classification (e.g., subdural, epidural, intraparenchymal haemorrhages).
Deploy as a cloud/web-based system for hospitals.
Integrate with PACS systems for seamless clinical workflow.
Incorporate Explainable AI for better clinician trust.

📌 Conclusion

The system proposes a scalable, AI-driven solution to assist in early and accurate detection of brain haemorrhages. With further refinement, it can serve as a reliable tool in emergency and radiology departments.
